This Wants to be my Diachronic garden,I will use Hugo's framework to curate it because it allows me to be fast in maintaining and ,instead of `html`, to use `.md` files  
which are very convinient for using in different second brain apps such as Obsidian.  So my ideal stream of work will be to Use my Obsidian notes apps
on my phone and on my work computer to draft Ideas that pop up in my mind, then i'll move them and edit them on the computer from which i will deploy.
As of now im unsure of my deploying strategy but i will eventually update it in some post.
I hope to maintain different fields in this garden, such as:
<ul>
<li>Language
<li>My undestanding of languages
<li>My undestanding of programming
<li>Tech
<li>Politics
<li>Literature
<li>whatever is around my mind
</ul>
It will be Diachronic because the theme I'm using allows for blog-style posting, so it will also assume the diary new to the old kind of feel. However feel free
to take whichever Synchronic path you find the most suitaible for you.Thankyou <3 be free
