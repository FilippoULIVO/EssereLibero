I'm currently Working as A software Developer at Accenture in a Project for Electic Mobility from the charge point infrastracture perspective.I code in Java in the backend.

I'm also cultivating my artist side by colaborating with the jeweler [13Truth](https://www.13truth.com/), Designing and 3d printing jewels with him for new collections to come.
I use an AnyCubic SLA 3d printer and Blender.
